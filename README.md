# Text Mining Radiology Reports

The task was to iterate through a zipped directory of multi-modal text files (including further zipped directories) containing synthetically generated radiology reports (CSV, Pickle and JSON) for patients with heart failure and extract the RV/LV ratios for each report which appear after a keyword. Once extracted the ratios were to be compiled and a mean ratio for all the reports was to be calculated and a histogram plotted.

Solutions:

The mean RV/LV ratio, calculated from 83222 reports is 1.201
